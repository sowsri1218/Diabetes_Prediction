**Diabetes_Prediction**

**1. Import the Libraries and Dataset:**
The project begins by importing essential Python libraries for data analysis, including Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

Matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.

Seaborn: For making statistical graphics.

The dataset, which contains information related to diabetes prediction, is then loaded for exploration and analysis.

**2. Data Exploration and Cleaning**

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): This step involves examining the dataset to understand its structure, identify patterns, and detect any anomalies or missing values.

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing any irrelevant or duplicate entries to ensure the dataset is ready for analysis.
