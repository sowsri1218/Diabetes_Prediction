# Diabetes Prediction

## Description
This project aims to analyze various factors that influence diabetes, such as age, gender, hypertension, blood glucose levels, smoking history, HbA1c levels, and BMI. By examining these factors, we can predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals.

# Objectives

**Analyze Factors**: Examine various factors such as age, sex, hypertension, blood glucose levels, smoking history, HbA1c levels, and BMI to understand their impact on diabetes.

**Predict Diabetes**: Develop a predictive model to estimate the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on the analyzed factors.

**Visualize Data**: Create visualizations to represent the relationships between different factors and diabetes, making it easier to interpret the data.

## Dataset

You can download the dataset from the CSV file attached to this project or from Kaggle.
