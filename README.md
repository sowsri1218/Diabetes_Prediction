# Objectives

**Analyze Factors**: Examine various factors such as age, sex, hypertension, blood glucose levels, smoking history, HbA1c levels, and BMI to understand their impact on diabetes.

**Predict Diabetes**: Develop a predictive model to estimate the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on the analyzed factors.

**Visualize Data**: Create visualizations to represent the relationships between different factors and diabetes, making it easier to interpret the data.
